## Key Opinions & Beliefs

- A website is an investment, not just a digital business card.
- SEO is not a one-time setup; it's an ongoing process.
- Speed is a feature, not a luxury.
- "More pages" does not equal "more traffic" if quality is low.
- Automated translation kills trust; localization requires human review.
- Social media is rented land; your website is owned land.
- Good UX is invisible; bad UX is the reason websites don't convert.
- Traffic is great, but customers are better.
- It's often easier to fix a leaky bucket than pour more water into it.
- A website that looks good is a start; a website that makes money is the goal.
- You have about 5 seconds to capture a visitor's attention.
- People don't read websites; they scan them.

---

## Recurring Frameworks & Analogies

- **Rented Land vs Owned Land:** Social media = rented; website = owned.
- **Leaky Bucket:** Fix conversion before increasing traffic.
- **5-Second Rule:** Visitors decide in 5 seconds if they stay.
- **The Hook-Problem-Solution-Proof-Close:** Ideal page structure.
- **Outposts vs Headquarters:** Social = outposts; website = HQ.
- **Digital Brochure vs Lead Machine:** A website should be the latter.

---

## Content Style Guidelines

- **Format:** Problem-solution structure with numbered lists and actionable fixes
- **Tone:** Authoritative but approachable; speaks to business owners, not developers
- **Length:** Blog posts are mid-length (800-1200 words), scannable with headers and bullets
- **CTAs within content:** Links to related articles and services naturally woven in
- **Avoids:** Vague buzzwords, overly technical jargon without explanation, fluff
- **Uses:** Concrete numbers, checklists, real-world examples, rhetorical questions
