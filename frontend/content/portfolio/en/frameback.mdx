## The Challenge

Video production teams struggle with inefficient review workflows. Sending videos back and forth via email, collecting feedback in spreadsheets, and losing track of revision history wastes countless hours. Teams needed a centralized platform where:

- Reviewers can leave time-coded comments directly on video
- Feedback is organized and easy to track
- Version control keeps everyone on the same page
- The review process is fast and intuitive

## The Solution

Frameback is a video feedback and review platform built for modern creative workflows. It brings together video hosting, frame-accurate commenting, and team collaboration into one streamlined experience.

The platform focuses on what matters most: making it effortless to share videos with stakeholders and collect actionable feedback without the back-and-forth chaos of traditional review methods.

## Key Features

**Time-Coded Comments**
Reviewers can click anywhere on the video timeline to leave comments at specific moments. Comments are pinned to exact frames, eliminating confusion about which part of the video needs attention.

**Frame-Accurate Playback**
Scrub through videos frame by frame to catch every detail. The player supports professional workflows with keyboard shortcuts and precise playback controls.

**Team Collaboration**
Invite team members, clients, and stakeholders to review projects. Control who can view, comment, or approve content with granular permissions.

**Version Management**
Upload new versions while keeping the full revision history. Compare versions side by side and track how feedback has been addressed across iterations.

**Notification System**
Stay on top of feedback with real-time notifications. Get alerted when someone comments, mentions you, or approves a video.

## Technical Highlights

The platform is built with performance in mind. Videos stream smoothly regardless of length, and the interface responds instantly to user interactions. The architecture handles large video files efficiently while maintaining a snappy user experience.

## Results

Frameback transforms chaotic review processes into organized, efficient workflows:

- **Faster approvals** through clear, time-coded feedback
- **Fewer revision cycles** by eliminating miscommunication
- **Centralized collaboration** replacing scattered email threads
- **Professional presentation** when sharing work with clients
