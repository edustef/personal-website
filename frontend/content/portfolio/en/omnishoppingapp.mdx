## The Vision

OmniShoppingApp is being built to solve a common frustration: shopping across multiple brands means juggling multiple apps, accounts, and checkout processes. We're creating a unified platform that brings everything together.

Imagine browsing products from your favorite brands, adding items to a single cart, and checking out once—regardless of how many different stores your items come from.

## Planned Features

**Unified Shopping Cart**
One cart for all brands. Add items from multiple stores and complete a single checkout. The system handles order routing and fulfillment behind the scenes.

**Smart Search & Discovery**
AI-powered search that understands natural language queries. Looking for "comfortable running shoes under $100"? The search understands intent, not just keywords.

**Personalized Recommendations**
Machine learning algorithms that learn your preferences over time. Get recommendations that actually match your style, size, and budget—without feeling creepy.

**Seamless Checkout**
Save your payment methods and shipping addresses once. Apple Pay and Google Pay integration for one-tap purchases on mobile.

**Real-Time Order Tracking**
Track all your orders from all brands in one place. Push notifications keep you updated on shipping status without checking multiple apps.

## Technical Architecture

**Frontend**
- Next.js for the web application with server-side rendering
- React Native for iOS and Android apps sharing 80% of code
- Tailwind CSS for consistent styling across platforms

**Backend**
- Node.js API with GraphQL for efficient data fetching
- PostgreSQL for reliable data storage
- Redis for caching and real-time features

**Integrations**
- Stripe Connect for multi-vendor payments
- Headless commerce APIs for brand catalog sync
- Shipping carrier APIs for real-time tracking

## Current Status
