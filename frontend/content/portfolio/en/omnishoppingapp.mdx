## The Vision

OmniShoppingApp is being built to solve a common frustration: planning meals and managing grocery shopping takes too much time and mental energy. We're creating an intelligent app that generates recipes based on your preferences and automatically builds organized shopping lists.

Imagine telling the app what you're craving, your dietary restrictions, and how many people you're cooking for—and getting personalized recipes with a ready-to-use shopping list organized by store aisle.

## Planned Features

**AI Recipe Generation**
Describe what you want to eat in plain language. The AI understands ingredients you have, dietary needs, cooking skill level, and time constraints to suggest perfect recipes.

**Smart Shopping Lists**
Recipes automatically generate shopping lists. Items are organized by category, quantities adjust based on servings, and the app remembers what you typically have at home.

**Meal Planning Calendar**
Plan your week's meals in advance. Drag and drop recipes to different days, and the app consolidates all ingredients into one efficient shopping list.

**Pantry Management**
Track what's in your kitchen. The app suggests recipes based on ingredients you already have and alerts you when staples are running low.

**Nutritional Insights**
See nutritional information for each recipe and track your weekly intake. Set goals for calories, protein, or other macros and get recipe suggestions that fit.

## Technical Architecture

**Frontend**
- Next.js for the web application with server-side rendering
- React Native for iOS and Android apps sharing 80% of code
- Tailwind CSS for consistent styling across platforms

**Backend**
- Node.js API with GraphQL for efficient data fetching
- PostgreSQL for reliable data storage
- Redis for caching and real-time features

**AI & Integrations**
- OpenAI API for natural language recipe generation
- Custom ML models for personalized recommendations
- Nutritional database integration for accurate macro tracking

## Current Status
