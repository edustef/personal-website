## The Challenge

Citadella is a heritage restaurant with over three decades of culinary excellence. Their existing web presence didn't reflect the sophistication of their dining experience. They needed a digital platform that would:

- Convey the restaurant's rich history and atmosphere
- Enable easy table reservations
- Showcase their seasonal menu with mouth-watering visuals
- Work flawlessly on mobile devices for on-the-go customers

## The Solution

I designed and built a landing page that treats every visitor like a guest walking through the restaurant's doors. The design uses warm, atmospheric colors and subtle animations that mirror the candlelit ambiance of the physical space.

The page architecture prioritizes the customer journey: from the hero section that immediately sets the mood, through the menu highlights, to a frictionless reservation flow that takes just seconds to complete.

## Key Features

**Atmospheric Design System**
Created a custom design system with carefully selected typography, a warm color palette derived from the restaurant's interior, and micro-animations that add sophistication without overwhelming the content.

**Smart Reservation Integration**
Integrated a reservation system that shows real-time availability. Guests can book a table in under 30 seconds, with automatic confirmation emails.

**Menu Showcase**
Built a visual menu browser that highlights seasonal specialties with high-quality imagery. The menu is easy to update through a headless CMS, allowing the restaurant to make changes without developer involvement.

**Mobile-First Experience**
Designed mobile-first to ensure the 60%+ of visitors on phones get an equally impressive experience. Touch-friendly navigation, optimized images, and fast load times make mobile browsing seamless.

## Results

The new website has transformed how Citadella connects with their guests:

- **40% increase** in online reservations within the first month
- **Sub-2-second** load times on mobile devices
- **Professional presentation** that matches their in-restaurant experience
- **Easy content management** for menu updates and special events
